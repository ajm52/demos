this one is simple enough: In the context of c++11, how does one go about emulating a list of mutices (plural of mutex)?

while the question is simple, the nature of the mutex makes the answer rather evasive. Based off of this thread [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16465633/how-can-i-use-something-like-stdvectorstdmutex), we shall see what we can do.
